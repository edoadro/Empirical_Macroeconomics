# Empirical_Macroeconomics: shock identification
This course provides a non-systematic account of a range of research methods in empirical macroeconomics to identify shocks. It is intended as an apprenticeship to students interested in working in research departments. Students will reproduce the results of three published paper and learn to code in Python.


_“Coding is not for just tech people, it is for anyone who wants to run a competitive company in the 21st century... These are skillsets of the future . . . By better understanding coding, our business teams can speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients.”_
