# Empirical Macroeconomics: the identification of shocks
This course provides a non-systematic account of a range of research methods in empirical macroeconomics to identify shocks. It is intended as an apprenticeship to students interested in working in research departments. Students will reproduce the results of three published paper and learn to code in Python.


_“Coding is not for just tech people, it is for anyone who wants to run a competitive company in the 21st century... These are skillsets of the future . . . By better understanding coding, our business teams can speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients.”_

Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan Asset Management october 2018

_"Bloody bad philosophy," grunted Alexandrov. "Waste of breath. Hypothesis judged by prediction. Only sound method."_

## Create an environment
To run the jupyter notebook you can create an environemnt that contains the pacakages listed in the file Environment_list.txt. For example in using conda

```
conda create -n myenv --file package-list.txt
```
## Introduction
A short history a econometrics methods in Macroeconomics. In this introductory class we follow Cristopher Sims 2011 Nobel lecture and present a condensed summary of the history of tought of empirical macroeconomics. We also reproduce Haavelmo 1943 model and present maximum likelihood and bayesian methods to estimate it.

## Fundamental shocks: VAR and SVAR
A short introduction to VAR and SVAR. The "probabilistic approach" justify under some conditions the estimation of the distribution of the data with a VAR. The "time-series approach" reaches the same conclusions trough the Wold decomposition. The latter approach is more intuitive to identify the type of shocks that can be recovered through a VAR.
